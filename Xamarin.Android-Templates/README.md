## What's included?
That is a great question! I have started with a few basics that I use every day:

### Project Templates

#### Navigation Drawer
This is a navigation drawer project template that builds in a light theme (optional dark theme) with a few fragments and a base activity.

This is a very simple menu that you can add and puts in the default resources and menu item.

This has a search button for your menu. I also provide the code that needs to be put into your Activity or Fragment to get it to work properly.
